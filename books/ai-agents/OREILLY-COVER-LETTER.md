# Cover Letter for O'Reilly Media

**To**: O'Reilly Media Acquisitions Team

**Subject**: Book Proposal — The AI-Powered One-Person Company

Dear O'Reilly Editorial Team,

I'm writing to propose a book that addresses what I believe is a critical gap in your catalog: **a practical implementation guide for AI agents in business operations**.

## The Book

**"The AI-Powered One-Person Company: From Solopreneur to Scale"** is a 500+ page practitioner's manual for building AI agent systems that enable solo entrepreneurs to operate at enterprise scale. Unlike theoretical AI books, this is based on systems I've built and deployed in my own business.

## Why Now

The timing is unprecedented:
- **Claude Cowork** launched January 2026, enabling general-purpose AI agents for knowledge work
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** has become the standard for AI-tool integration
- **Production-quality AI agents** are now economically viable at \$4.5K/year vs \$130K+ for human equivalents

Yet there's no authoritative guide helping practitioners implement these systems. Your audience—developers, tech-savvy entrepreneurs, and business operators—are actively searching for this content.

## Why O'Reilly

O'Reilly's reputation for authoritative, practical technical content is exactly what this topic needs. This isn't a theoretical exploration—it's a handbook with actual prompts, code, and workflows readers can deploy immediately.

## Manuscript Status

**The book is 90%+ complete** with both English and Chinese versions ready for review. I can provide:
- Complete PDF proofs immediately
- Any chapter for detailed evaluation
- All source files (LaTeX, code samples, diagrams)

## Next Steps

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal with an acquisitions editor. I'm confident this book would resonate strongly with O'Reilly's audience and establish a new category in your AI/business collection.

The complete proposal document is attached.

Best regards,

**Jim Xiao**
