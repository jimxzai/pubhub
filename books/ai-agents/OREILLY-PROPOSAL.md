# O'Reilly Book Proposal

## The AI-Powered One-Person Company
### From Solopreneur to Scale: Building Your AI Agent Team

---

## 1. Book Description

### Topic
A practical, hands-on guide to building and deploying AI agent systems that enable solo entrepreneurs and small business owners to operate at the scale of a traditional company—without hiring a team.

### Audience
- **Primary**: Solo entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small business owners (1-5 employees) who want to leverage AI to scale operations
- **Secondary**: Technical professionals exploring AI-native workflows, product managers evaluating AI agent integration
- **Tertiary**: Business strategists and executives researching the future of work

### Purpose
This book provides a complete implementation guide for building an "AI workforce"—specialized AI agents that handle customer support, financial operations, content creation, sales automation, and operations management. Readers will learn not just the theory, but receive actual prompts, workflows, and code to deploy these systems immediately.

### Unique Value Proposition
Unlike theoretical AI books, this is a **practitioner's manual** based on actual deployed systems. The author has built and operates these AI agents in his own business, documenting real costs, actual time savings, and honest failure modes.

## 2. Market Analysis

### Market Opportunity
- **Timing**: Claude, GPT-4, and other frontier models have reached production quality in 2024-2026
- **Gap**: Most AI books focus on either (a) technical ML engineering or (b) high-level strategy—few address practical business implementation
- **Trend**: The "AI-native company" is emerging as a new category, with tools like Claude Code, MCP, and Claude Cowork launching in late 2025/early 2026

### Target Market Size
- 33+ million solo entrepreneurs in the US alone
- Growing "solopreneur" economy accelerated by remote work
- Massive interest in AI productivity tools (ChatGPT: 100M+ users)

### Competitive Analysis

| Book | Publisher | Gap This Book Fills |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| *Building LLM Apps* (Various) | O'Reilly, Manning | Technical focus—misses business operations |
| *AI for Business* (Generic) | Various | Too high-level, no implementation details |
| *Prompt Engineering Guides* | Self-pub | Tactical tips, no strategic framework |
| *The AI-Powered One-Person Company* | **Proposed** | Complete system: agents + prompts + workflows + real costs |

### Comparable Successful Titles
- *"Company of One"* by Paul Jarvis — Business philosophy (this book provides the AI implementation)
- *"The E-Myth Revisited"* — Systems thinking for small business (this updates for AI era)
- *"Building a Second Brain"* by Tiago Forte — Knowledge management (Chapter 21 directly extends this)
