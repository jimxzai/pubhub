## Preface: Why This Dialogue?

Two books have shaped the moral imagination of billions across millennia. One tells the story of God's redemptive work through Israel and Christ; the other chronicles sixteen centuries of Chinese political wisdom. When these two monuments of human civilization are placed in dialogue, something remarkable emerges: a conversation that illuminates both the universal longings of the human heart and the unique hope found only in the Gospel.

### The Bible: God's Revelation to Humanity

The Bible, composed over approximately 1,500 years by more than 40 authors, tells one unified story: creation, fall, redemption, and restoration. From Genesis to Revelation, Scripture reveals:

- **Who God is**: The Creator, Sustainer, and Redeemer of all things
- **Who we are**: Image-bearers of God, fallen yet capable of redemption
- **What went wrong**: Sin entered through human rebellion
- **How it's being fixed**: Through Christ's incarnation, death, and resurrection
- **Where it's all going**: The new heaven and new earth

### Comprehensive Mirror: History as Teacher

*Zizhi Tongjian* (资治通鉴), literally "Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government," was compiled by Sima Guang (司马光, 1019-1086 AD) during the Song Dynasty. This monumental work covers 1,362 years of Chinese history (403 BC - 959 AD) in 294 chapters, making it one of the most comprehensive historical texts ever written.

Sima Guang's purpose was explicitly pedagogical. In his memorial to Emperor Shenzong, he wrote:

> "Your servant has been extremely stupid from birth, knowing nothing except that when I see events of former ages that may serve as warnings for the future, I cannot remain silent about them."

The title itself contains profound meaning:
- **资** (zi): "to aid, to provide resources for"
- **治** (zhi): "governance, bringing order"
- **通** (tong): "comprehensive, throughout"
- **鉴** (jian): "mirror, to reflect upon"

History, for Sima Guang, was meant to be a mirror—a tool for reflection that could help rulers avoid past mistakes and emulate past virtues.

## Why Place These Books in Dialogue?

### 1. Both Address Ultimate Questions

Despite their vastly different contexts, both texts grapple with humanity's deepest questions:

| Question | Biblical Answer | Tongjian's Observation |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| What is human nature? | Image of God, yet fallen | Capable of both good and evil |
| Why do people suffer? | Sin's consequences | Moral failure and cosmic cycles |
| What makes a good leader? | Servant-hearted, God-fearing | Virtuous, wise, and benevolent |
| Is there hope for humanity? | Yes, in Christ alone | Uncertain; depends on moral cultivation |

### 2. Bridge-Building for Apologetics

Many Chinese intellectuals view Christianity as a "Western religion"—foreign to Chinese culture and thought. This dialogue demonstrates:

- Biblical history overlaps chronologically with Tongjian's coverage
- Universal human experiences appear in both traditions
- The Gospel addresses questions Chinese philosophy leaves unanswered

### 3. Deepening Discipleship

For Chinese Christians, understanding their cultural heritage through biblical lenses:

- Strengthens cultural identity while maintaining Gospel centrality
- Provides vocabulary for evangelism to Chinese non-believers
- Reveals God's providence working in all human history

## The Four Themes

This project organizes the dialogue around four major themes:

### Theme 1: Seeing Human Nature 透视人性

**Key Question**: What is humanity's fundamental nature and problem?

**Biblical Foundation**: Humans are created in God's image (Genesis 1:26-27) but are fallen through sin (Genesis 3; Romans 3:23). This "already dignified, yet deeply broken" understanding explains both human greatness and human depravity.

**Tongjian's Witness**: The historical record serves as a laboratory of human nature. From the cruelty of tyrants to the nobility of martyrs, Tongjian reveals what the Bible teaches: "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure" (Jeremiah 17:9).

**Sample Parallel**:

| Biblical Account | Tongjian Account |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Cain and Abel** (Genesis 4) | **Cao Pi and Cao Zhi** |
| Jealousy leads to fratricide | Jealousy drives brother against brother |
| Sin crouches at the door | Ambition corrupts family bonds |
| "Am I my brother's keeper?" | "The beans are burned to cook the peas" |

### Theme 2: Seeking a Way Out 寻找出路

**Key Question**: Is there a solution to humanity's predicament?

**Biblical Foundation**: Human effort cannot save us. "There is no one righteous, not even one" (Romans 3:10). Salvation comes through Christ alone—by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9).

**Tongjian's Witness**: Despite centuries of moral philosophy, ritual propriety, and governmental reform, the cycle of rise and fall, virtue and corruption, continues unbroken. History demonstrates that human solutions are insufficient.

**The Gospel Opportunity**: Where Chinese thought recognizes the problem but lacks an adequate solution, the Gospel provides what human effort cannot achieve: a righteousness that comes from outside ourselves.

### Theme 3: Knowing God's Plan 认识神的计划

**Key Question**: Is history going somewhere, or merely cycling?

**Biblical Foundation**: History is linear, moving toward God's predetermined end—the return of Christ and the establishment of His eternal kingdom (Revelation 21-22). "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ" (Revelation 11:15).

**Tongjian's Witness**: Chinese historiography tends toward cyclical patterns: dynasties rise, flourish, decline, and fall. "The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide." Yet within this cycle, there are glimpses of longing for something more—a "Great Harmony" (大同) that never quite materializes.

**The Gospel Contrast**: Biblical eschatology offers what cyclical history cannot: genuine hope, ultimate justice, and eternal restoration.

### Theme 4: Understanding Spiritual Warfare 明白属灵争战

**Key Question**: What unseen forces shape human history?

**Biblical Foundation**: "Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world" (Ephesians 6:12). History is the arena of cosmic conflict between God's kingdom and Satan's rebellion.

**Tongjian's Witness**: Chinese historiography, while typically focused on human agency, contains accounts that hint at supernatural dimensions—omens, prophecies, inexplicable events. More importantly, the recurrent patterns of evil reveal a consistency that suggests forces beyond mere human choice.

**Integration**: Reading Tongjian through biblical lenses helps us see that the rise and fall of empires is not merely political but spiritual—part of the great drama moving toward God's final victory.

## A Note on Methodology

### What This Is

This resource is an exercise in **comparative theology** and **cultural apologetics**. It takes seriously both:

- The unique authority of Scripture as God's inspired Word
- The genuine insights and historical value of Chinese literary heritage

### What This Is Not

This is **not**:

- An attempt to equate Scripture with Chinese classics
- A claim that Chinese philosophy can save
- A syncretistic blending of Christianity with Confucianism
- A replacement for biblical exposition

### Our Conviction

We hold firmly that:

1. **The Bible alone is God's authoritative Word** (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
2. **Salvation is through Christ alone** (John 14:6; Acts 4:12)
3. **All truth is God's truth**, wherever it is found
4. **Cultural engagement serves Gospel proclamation**

The goal is not to legitimize Christianity through Chinese culture, but to demonstrate that Christ fulfills what culture cannot provide, and that the Gospel speaks to the deepest questions the Chinese tradition has been asking for millennia.

## Sample Passage: The Problem of Power

### Biblical Text: 1 Samuel 8:10-18

> Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. He said, "This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses... He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage... When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you in that day."

### Tongjian Text: Advice to Emperor Taizong of Tang

> 太宗问侍臣："创业与守成孰难？"房玄龄曰："草昧之初，与群雄并起角力而后臣之，创业难矣。"魏征曰："自古帝王，莫不得之于艰难，失之于安逸，守成难矣。"太宗曰："玄龄与吾共取天下，出百死，得一生，故知创业之难。征与吾共安天下，常恐骄奢生于富贵，祸乱生于所忽，故知守成之难。然创业之难，既已往矣；守成之难，方当与诸公慎之。"

**Translation**:

> Emperor Taizong asked his attendants: "Which is more difficult—founding a dynasty or maintaining one?" Fang Xuanling replied: "At the beginning, when chaos prevailed and you had to compete with other heroes, subdue them, and make them your subjects—founding a dynasty is difficult." Wei Zheng replied: "Since ancient times, all emperors have won their empires through hardship but lost them through complacency. Maintaining a dynasty is more difficult." Taizong said: "Xuanling and I together conquered the realm, escaping death a hundred times to survive once—thus I know the difficulty of founding. Zheng and I together bring peace to the realm, always fearing that arrogance and extravagance grow from wealth and honor, and that disaster grows from neglect—thus I know the difficulty of maintaining. But the difficulty of founding has already passed; the difficulty of maintaining is what I and all of you must be careful about from now on."

### Comparative Analysis

**Similarities**:
- Both texts recognize that power is dangerous
- Both warn against complacency and abuse
- Both understand that rulers are prone to corruption

**Differences**:
- Samuel speaks prophetically, warning that human kingship inherently tends toward oppression
- Taizong speaks pragmatically, hoping that wisdom can prevent the worst outcomes
- Scripture points to God as the true King; Tongjian accepts human kingship as given

**Gospel Insight**:
Even the most enlightened ruler (Taizong is generally considered one of China's greatest emperors) could not prevent the corruption he feared. Within two generations, his dynasty produced Yang Guifei's corruption of Emperor Xuanzong. Scripture's diagnosis is more radical: the problem is not just individual rulers but the human heart. The solution is not better governance but a new heart—something only Christ can provide.

### Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think God warned Israel about the dangers of kingship?
2. What does Taizong's fear of "arrogance and extravagance" reveal about human nature?
3. How does Jesus' model of servant leadership (Mark 10:42-45) differ from both Samuel's warning and Taizong's ideal?
4. What implications does this have for how Christians engage with political power today?
